change the functions to receive an array of elements instead of every single elements

a function should try to have one or two parameters only

the function should NOT validate inside it. Validation is another function. even if you need one function for each variable

check for function that have booleans as parameters, they must be refactored to NOT receive booleans

use _nameOfVariable inside the function so it is considered local to the function
